    RecipeName : "Gluten Free Flour",
    ContributorName: "minimalistbaker.com",
	Ingredients: "1 1/2 cups (240 g) brown rice flour<br>1/2 cup (96 g) potato starch<br>1/4 cup (40 g) white rice flour<br>1/4 cup (30 g) tapioca flour<br>optional: 1 tsp xanthan gum (not necessary)",
	Directions: "Blend together and store in a secure container in a dry place (I prefer a large mason jar).<br>This can be tricky because gluten free flours react differently in pretty much every recipe. But in general, use in place of all purpose or whole wheat flour in a 1:1 ratio. For extra binding (since there is no gluten) you can add a pinch of xanthan gum depending on the recipe, but I don't find it necessary.<br>This blend has worked wonders in muffins, cakes, quick breads, gingerbread cookies, corn bread, waffles, crepes and many other recipes.<br>I also have a Gluten Free Whole Grain Pancake Mix that works beautifully with an egg. And a Gluten Free Pizza Crust that utilizes a slight variation of this blend.",

	Directions: "Drain, but do not rinse, the black beans. Place them in a bowl and use a fork to mash them. Keep mashing until they're mostly broken up, but still have some whole beans visible. Add the breadcrumbs, onion, egg, chili powder, salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Stir until everything is combined, then let the mixture sit for 5 minutes. <br><br>Heat a tablespoon or two of olive oil with an equal amount of butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Form the bean mixture into patties slightly larger than the buns you're using (the patties will not shrink when they cook.) Place the patties in the skillet and cook them about 5 minutes on the first side. Flip them to the other side, place 2 slices of cheese onto each patty, and continue cooking them for another 5 minutes, or until the burgers are heated through. (Place a lid on the skillet to help the cheese melt if needed.)<br><br>Grill the buns on a griddle with a little butter until golden. Spread the buns with mayonnaise and hot sauce, then place the patties on the buns. Top with lettuce and tomato, then pop on the lids!",

Mix wet into dry to form a dough, then refrigerate 30 minutes before baking. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Put dough in a plastic bag, and smush into one big ball. Remove from bag, roll into a thin dough, and cut flat circles using a circle cutter or a circle-shaped lid. Bake on a greased cookie tray for 10 minutes; they’ll still look a little underdone when they come out of the oven, but that’s ok. Important: allow to cool 10 minutes before removing from the tray.<br><br>To make the filling, mix all filling ingredients in a small food processor (or patiently, with a fork). (If using coconut butter, make sure it is melted.) Put about a scant teaspoon-full (3g) on half of the cookie discs, then top each with remaining cookie discs and fridge so filling firms up. Store in the fridge so the filling stays hard.",
